# Excel-Sales

This Excel Sales was created by me when I was looking for an internship opportunity. I wanted to show my knowledges with Excel and VBA and also help my aunt who had 
a store that sold sandwiches. At that time, she hadn't anything to control her sales, orders and wastes. I created many sheets with many forms so she could fill the forms with the information. I didn't complete 100% of this project because I got hired and didn't have more time to keep building this Excel. 

I gave my best, because I knew I'd learn lots from it. 

It was a good experience creating it. I have learned a lot about VBA and Excel. I don't have plans on going back to this project by now, because and want focus on things
that can bring a better professional return (courses, learn new tools, portfolio).
